</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup white wine</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1: Place each chicken breast between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap. Pound breasts to 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or small heavy skillet.</li>
    <l1>2: Spread flour into a wide, shallow dish. Press chicken into flour to coat completely.</l1>
    <l1>3: Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook chicken in hot butter mixture until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken from skillet to a serving platter and cover with a lid to keep warm.</l1>
    <l1>4: Pour white wine, lemon juice, capers, and garlic into the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; cook at a boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.</l1>
    <l1>5: Drizzle sauce over and around the chicken; garnish with parsley.</l1>
</ul>
