<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
    If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (4 pound) prime rib roast</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
    <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1: Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.</li>
    <li>2: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
    <li>3: Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
    <li>4: Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>
    <li>5: Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>6: Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
</ul>
